# MobileTogether-geolocation-example
Example mobile app to demonstrate GPS, REST Web service as a data source for a mobile app, how to save and email a data file from a mobile app, and device-dependent workflows.

This mobile app demonstrates a battery-saving approach to GPS tracking by recording coordinates on-demand instead of by continuous tracking. The app improves the notoriously inaccurate GPS elevation value via a call to the USGS Elevation REST Web service to look up the accurate value.
